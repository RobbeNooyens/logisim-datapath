# Logisim Datapath
Bachelor in Computer Science

## Project overview

This project is made for the Computer Architecture course at the University of Antwerp. The repository consists of 7 projects that we made in pairs. The first few projects are separate exercises to get familiar with Logisim, the tool that's being used to draw logical circuits. The goal of the other projects is to build a full datapath yourself with an ALU, program counter, control unit, and other structures. Each folder also contains an HTML file. This is the report written after finishing the tasks and explains how the Logisim projects were made.

## Install

 1. Download the repository.
 2. Navigate to any project folder.
 3. Double-click the HTML file to open the report.
 4. To view and run the circuits, download Logisim and open a .circ file
    from Logisim > File > Open.
